# dotfiles

- A repo containing my public dotfiles. Not included are some more sensitive files (eg .ssh) and other work stuff.

## Usage

- I would recommend using symlinks to 'place' these dotfiles in your home directory `~`.
  - Clone this directory
  - `ln -sv /path/to/a/dotfile ~` will create a symlink to your home directory, where most programs expect dotfiles to be.
